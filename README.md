# Gear-Extruder-MAZE
## About
Recently i have made a fork from ***Prusa Mendel*** || **THE [maZE Mendel](https://github.com/3devangelist/PrusaMendel)** , and i have updated some parts from the original, that's is because i fork it!
 One of the parts i have changed is the extruder and i have use the [saintFlint](https://github.com/3devangelist/PrusaMendel#141-saintflint), but i found a [hobbed bolt](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0872/7944/products/1_8c6b686b-f2ac-4743-8a19-2f0bfe31ab02.jpg?v=1491874714), and want to try out the ancient extruder and i found the [Ultimate Greg's Wade's Geared Extruder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:961630), printed it on my BTF+ and beside some misalignment and bad extruder cave, it was very good, and the aesthetics fits well with my mendel.

I did some research for new designs base on the Wade's and i see the that Luzbot used these extruder from the beginning, like they are open Source i downloaded the sources from the website and started from there.

## Modeling

I am a blender Hardcoreuser, if you dont like it deal with it!
I started to export de Freecad version of luzbot with all the parts, then export it in STL, and in blender i have cleaned up all the parts i dont need, and saved (\BASE\Extruder_base_luzbot_TAZ6.blend).

### Changes

![](\images\Corte_inicial.png)
I want to close the gap (1) in the extruder most possible, the luzbot use a PTFE tube that i will use to, but i cant reliable think that the tube is locking in the place, i have to make a way to fix the tube.

First step is done!
I make the easy way possible fill, add a cube and then cavity for the bearing and for the M8 Bolt.

If you want to test it on your TAZ6 you can print it and test it! then say to me how it preforms ! (maZE_LUZ_Extruder.blend)

To use on maze i dont need any monting holes then i have cut it out!

1- Close the original gap, i think i cant use these for TPU because is for a bowden, but i want to print Nylon and others more flexy filaments.
